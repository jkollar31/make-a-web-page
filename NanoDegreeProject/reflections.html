<h1>Reflections</h1><p><b>Stage 1</b></p><p>What I have learned so far is that by using HTML documents we can display and share information across the web.
HTML documents are made up of things like text, files, images, videos, and  links to other webpages like <a href="www.reddit.com">reddit</a>.
In order to manipulate the information on an HTML documemt we use <em>tags</em> and <em>attributes</em>.</p>
<p>Tags can either be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b></p>
<b>Inline</b> meaning the information just continues on wrapping around.<br>
<b>Block</b> meaning the information is contained with in a block.<p>
Since HTML is a great way for sharing and displaying information it would be great for displaying information about yourself if you wanted to display your skills of say:
creating a webpage, showing a video of your talent, or sharing a new song you just wrote.
